          <p>A: Canon 5D Mark iii
            <br> A: I love shooting landscapes, especially in the morning as the sun is rising. The colors are so vivid
            and beautiful in the morning, which not a lot of people witness it.
            <br> I would say my Grandpa. Even though he passed away in 1995 and was never a professional photographer, the
            pictures I’ve seen he has taken are amazing. I love the colors and the angles he would take.
            <br> I always loved taking pictures, especially to help me remember certain events. It wasn’t until I started
            college that I really started getting into it and realized I enjoy it, why not try to make money from it. When
            I started taking pictures professionally, I never wanted to make it a burden and not enjoyable. I wanted to push
            myself but at the same time love to do it. That's the goal that I have while starting North Forty Photography.
            I want to share my talents with other for them to enjoy them as well.
            <br> I am always exploring the outdoors. Going places where people don’t usually go and experience. I’ve
            seen sunrises and sunsets from beaches, on top of mountain tops, in the city and am always in awe of what God
            has created. I remember the first sunset I took and showed my family and friends. They loved it. It was something
            different, something they haven’t seen before and thats what I want my work to show. Something that is different
            and can show the beautiful place that God created.
            <br> I graduated from Utah Valley University in Digital Media with an emphasis of in Internet Technology.
            While studying at UVU, I studied digital photography in my degree for several years. I’ve been taking professional
            pictures since 2009.

						<h2>Q&A with North Forty</h2>
						<p> <i>What drone do you have?</i>
						<br>
						 I have a DJI Phantom 4
							<br> <i>What is drone videography / photography?</i>
							<br>
							 Drone Aerial photography is flying a unmanned aerial vehicle in the
							air and recording and taking pictures from above. It adds a different view then what we are use to.
							<br> <i>What kinds of events do you do?</i>
							<br>
							 I do all sorts of events. I’ve filmed wake surfing, mountain biking, ATV’s, weddings.
							If someone has an idea then I can make that idea a reality.
							<br> <i>How does your pricing work? </i><br>
							 I currently have several packages for different projects. Contact me for pricing.
							<br> <i>What sets you apart from the competition?</i> <br>I would say my knowledge and skills of photography/videography. I’ve
							studied several years at UVU about this topic plus hours and hours of real life experience. I am able to turn any
							idea/dream into a reality.</p>
