                        <h2>Photography</h2>
                        <p><b> Q: What camera do you use?</b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: Canon 5D Mark iii
                            <br>
                            <b>Q: What is your favorite subject?</b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I love shooting landscapes, especially in the morning as the sun is rising.
                            The colors are so vivid and beautiful in the morning, which not a lot of people witness it.
                            <br>
                            <b> Q: What photographer inspires you?</b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; I would say my Grandpa. Even though he passed away in 1995 and was never a
                            professional photographer, the pictures I’ve seen he has taken are amazing. I love the colors
                            and the angles he would take. <br>
                            <b> Q: What was your career path? Was photography all what you aspired to do? </b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I always loved taking pictures, especially to help me remember certain
                            events. It wasn’t until I started college that I really started getting into it and realized
                            I enjoy it, why not try to make money from it. When I started taking pictures professionally,
                            I never wanted to make it a burden and not enjoyable. I wanted to push myself but at the same
                            time love to do it. That's the goal that I have while starting North Forty Photography. I want
                            to share my talents with other for them to enjoy them as well.

                            <b>Q: What do you want to say with your photography and how do you get your photos to do that? </b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I am always exploring the outdoors. Going places where people don’t usually
                            go and experience. I’ve seen sunrises and sunsets from beaches, on top of mountain tops, in the
                            city and am always in awe of what God has created. I remember the first sunset I took and showed
                            my family and friends. They loved it. It was something different, something they haven’t seen
                            before and thats what I want my work to show. Something that is different and can show the beautiful
                            place that God created. <br>

                        <h2>Videography</h2>
                        <p> <b>Q: What drone do you have?</b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I have a DJI Phantom 4
                            <br> <b>Q: What is drone videography / photography?</b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: Drone Aerial photography is flying a unmanned aerial vehicle in the air
                            and recording and taking pictures from above. It adds a different view then what we are use to.
                            <br> <b> Q: What kinds of events do you do?</b>
                            <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I do all sorts of events. I’ve filmed wake surfing, mountain biking, ATV’s,
                            weddings. If someone has an idea then I can make that idea a reality.
                            <br> <b>Q: How does your pricing work? </b><br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I currently have several packages
                            for different projects. Contact me for pricing.
                            <br> <b> Q: What sets you apart from the competition?</b> <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I would say my
                            knowledge and skills of photography/videography. I’ve studied several years at UVU about this
                            topic plus hours and hours of real life experience. I am able to turn any idea/dream into a reality.

                        <b>Q: What are you experience/ skills? </b>
                        <br> &emsp; &nbsp; A: I graduated from Utah Valley University in Digital Media with an emphasis of
                        in Internet Technology. While studying at UVU, I studied digital photography in my degree for several
                       years. I’ve been taking professional pictures since 2009 and drone videography since 2015.
